# Complex-Number-Arithmetic-Operation

Problem statement: Create a Python program that performs basic arithmetic operations on complexnumbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. The program should also calculate the absolute value (magnitude) of a complex number.

Constraints:

. The program should accept input for two complex numbers, each represented by a pair of real and imaginary parts.

. The real and imaginary parts of the complex numbers should be floating-point numbers.

. The program should correctly handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations for complex numbers.

. Division by zero should be avoided.

. The program should calculate and display the absolute value (magnitude) of a complex number correctly.

. The program should be implemented using object-oriented programming concepts, defining a Complex class with appropriate methods for performing arithmetic operations and calculating the absolute value.

. Ensure proper documentation of the methods and functionalities of the Complex class.  

. Utilize appropriate exception handling to handle potential errors, such as invalid input formats or division by zero.   

. The output should display the result of each operation performed on the given complex numbers, including the absolute value of a complex number.

. The program should be modular, with the Complex class defined in a separate module and imported into the main script for usage.
